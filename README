    make

Tool
=====
The tool consists of 2 parts: flows1 and flows2.

    Description:
        The flows1 part of the tool attempts to identify each individual flow within the provided trace.
        The flows2 part of the tool attempts to identify each individual flow within the provided log of ulogd2.
      Identification occurs when the flow has concluded or expired.

    Usage:
        ./Flows [-u <inputURI>] [-r] [-l <inputLOG>] [-c <connInfo>]

    Options:
        -u  <inputURI>  URI to trace that is supported by libtrace for analysing flows1
        -r  Don't ignore flows involving private RFC 1918 address space for flows1 (Ignored by default)
        -l  <inputLOG>  URI to LOG file for analysing flows2
        -c  <connInfo>  SQL connection info string. Example: "host=localhost dbname=mydb user=postgres password=12345"

    Output:
        For each flow in the input trace and LOG file information describing the flow is printed to TimescaleDB
        database every 2 minutes into tables "flows1" and "flows2".

        flows1 output format:
            time(INTEGER, NOT NULL), src_ip(TEXT), src_port(TEXT), dst_ip(TEXT),
            dst_port(TEXT), protocl(TEXT), duration(DOUBLE PRECISION)

        flows2 output format:
            time(INTEGER, NOT NULL), src_ip(TEXT), dst_port(TEXT), count(COUNT)
